        <p>We take simple ideas <em>seriously.</em></p>
        <p>Our approach is somewhat unconventional.</p>
        <p>Most teams present elaborate processes and proprietary frameworks.</p>
        <p>We believe the best process is no process at allâ€”just clear thinking applied consistently.</p>
        <p>Take this website: we identified what visitors need to know, then said exactly that. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
        <p>This is what we mean by taking simple ideas seriously: understand what matters, then execute it properly.</p>
        <p>Every project starts the same way. Just clear thinking applied consistently.</p>
